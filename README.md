# JS LINN

A fun JavaScript project I built with the help of a Wes Bos course! Done in delicious vanilla Javascript, this is a basic online version of the classic Linn LM-1 Drum Computer!

# The Linn LM-1: A Brief History:

The Linn LM-1 Drum Computer is the first sample-based drum machine. To non-musicians/non-gear nerds, that means it was the first drum machine that played samples of actual drums! Released in 1980, it was groundbreaking technology for its time, and was quickly adopted by many legendary musicians and producers such as Prince, Quincy Jones, Jeff Porcaro (Toto), and countless others. Only around 550 units were ever built, before being superceded by the even more popular LinnDrum in 1982.
